# gim [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/funraiseme/gim.png)](https://travis-ci.org/funraiseme/gim)

ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick child process wrapper.

## API

### Switching between GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick

By default, each instance checks for `gim.prototype.GraphicsMagick`.
You can either set this value on the prototype or a subclass.
You can also set the library as an option on each instance.

```js
var gim = require('gim')
gim.prototype.GraphicsMagick = true
```

or

```js
var gim = require('gim').extend()
gim.prototype.GraphicsMagick = true
```

or

```js
var gim = require('gim')

gim('img.png', {
  GraphicsMagick: true
})
```

or

```js
var gim = require('gim')

gim('img.png', {
  ImageMagick: false
})
```

### Inputs

Inputs can either be:

- filename
- Buffer
- Readable Stream

The first way to use it is as an argument:

```js
gim(filename)
gim(buffer)
gim(stream)
```

Another way is to use it as stream:

```js
gim().spawn().end(buffer)
stream.pipe(gim().spawn())
```

Note: You can not use  a `gim()` instance as a stream until `gim().spawn()` (or a method that executes it) is called as the underlying child process has not yet been spawned.

### Outputs

If you want a string output, such as when using `gim().identify()`,
you can use `gim().toString(callback)`.

```js
gim('img.png').identify(function (err, value) {

})
```

is equivalent to:

```js
gim().exec('identify', ['-verbose', 'img.png'], function (err, value) {

})
```

You can also pipe `gim` as a stream by using `gim().pipe()`.
Note that you must `gim().spawn()` before you using `gim` as a stream:

```js
gim('img.png').convert('-quality', '80').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('img.jpg'))
```
